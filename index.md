## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hlc1209/m202acourseproject.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hlc1209/m202acourseproject.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# Abstract

Image recognition is an emerging field with varieties of applications spanning from disease diagnosis, facial recognition, monitoring systems, to simply entertainment and human machine interface. Years ago, machine learning algorithms were computation-demanding, which is a major roadblock for the delivery of image recognition service with lower-cost and low-power embedded system. As the performance, robustness, and the resouce-efficent techniques for machine learnings have been significantly improved over the years, the application of low-cost and high-performance device for human-device interaction becomes possible.
